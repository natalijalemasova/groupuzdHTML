<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
<p class="prol" >Two households, both alike in dignity, <br>
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, <br>
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, <br>
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. <br>
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes <br>
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life; <br>
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows <br>
Do with their death bury their parents' strife. <br>
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love, <br>
And the continuance of their parents' rage, <br>
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove, <br>
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage; <br>
The which if you with patient ears attend, <br>
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. <br>
</p>
<h3>MONTAGUE</h3>
<p class="mont">Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach? <br>
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began? <br>
</p>
<h3>BENVOLIO</h3>
<p class="mont">Here were the servants of your adversary, <br>
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach: <br>
I drew to part them: in the instant came <br>
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared, <br>
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears, <br>
He swung about his head and cut the winds, <br>
Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn: <br>
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, <br>
Came more and more and fought on part and part, <br>
Till the prince came, who parted either part. <br>
